# Tesla-Stock-Price prediction model
Building a Tesla stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a complex task, and it involves several steps. Here are the detailed steps for creating such a model:

Step 1: Data Collection

Gather historical stock price data for Tesla (TSLA). You can obtain this data from financial websites, APIs, or data providers like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
Collect additional relevant features like trading volume, news sentiment, or macroeconomic indicators if you believe they may help improve prediction accuracy.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Clean and preprocess the data. This may involve handling missing values, adjusting for stock splits, and ensuring the data is in a suitable format.
Normalize or scale the data to ensure all input features are on a similar scale. Standardization (z-score scaling) is commonly used.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A typical split might be 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
Step 3: Sequence Data Preparation

Convert the time series data into sequences that can be used to train the LSTM model.
Choose a suitable sequence length (e.g., 30 days of historical data to predict the next day's stock price) and create overlapping sequences from the training data.
Step 4: Model Architecture

Design the LSTM model architecture. A simple architecture may consist of one or more LSTM layers followed by one or more fully connected (dense) layers.
Experiment with the number of LSTM units, dropout rates, and other hyperparameters to find the best model configuration.
Decide whether to use additional features (e.g., trading volume, sentiment scores) as inputs alongside historical stock prices.
Step 5: Model Training

Compile the LSTM model, specifying the loss function (usually mean squared error for regression tasks) and an optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam).
Train the model using the training dataset and validate its performance using the validation dataset.
Monitor training metrics such as loss and validation loss to ensure the model is learning effectively.
Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting by monitoring validation loss and stopping training when it starts to increase.
Step 6: Model Evaluation

Evaluate the trained LSTM model using the test dataset, which it hasn't seen before.
Calculate relevant evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and visualize the model's predictions against the actual stock prices.
Step 7: Hyperparameter Tuning

Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of LSTM layers) to optimize the model's performance.
